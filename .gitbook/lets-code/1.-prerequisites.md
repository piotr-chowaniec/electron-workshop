# 1. Prerequisites

{% hint style="info" %}
This Workshop assumes you're already familiar with building both frontend and backend JS applications. We won't dive into details about those concepts here.
{% endhint %}

***

1. Check what `Node.js` version you're currently working at and switch to 18 LTS

{% code fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
node -v
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```
{% endcode %}

2. Check out if you have `yarn` installed locally and if not, do so.\
   During the workshop, we'll be using `yarn` `v1.22.19`

```bash
yarn -v
npm i -g yarn
```

3. Clone boilerplate repository prepared for a workshop so we can focus on building a simple Electron application rather than fighting with project configuration.\
   For more info about boilerplate check out the [electron-workshop](https://github.com/piotr-chowaniec/electron-workshop) repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:piotr-chowaniec/electron-workshop.git
```

4. Checkout to `stage-0` tag and create your own branch for local development

```bash
git checkout stage-0
git checkout -b my-local-development-branch-name
```

5. Finally, install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Now it's time for you to buckle up and start working with Electron :muscle:
