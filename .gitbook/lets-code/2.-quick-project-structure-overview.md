# 2. Quick project structure overview

The project boilerplate was built based on [electron-forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) + [@electron-forge/plugin-vite](https://www.electronforge.io/config/plugins/vite) + `vite` template. However, this boilerplate has some major changes to improve scalability:

1. Introduced [monorepo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3cANGNPyx0) structure using [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).\
   There are separate sub-projects for:
   * electron main process
   * react based renderers
   * common code that has to be shared - eg types definitions
2. It's TypeScript ready
3. It's a working example of an Electron multiple windows application

```
packages/
  common/           # shared code
  main/             # electron main process
  renderers/
    login-window/   # login renderer react project
    main/           # main renderer react project

```

In the meantime, after I started working on this workshop, electron-forge shared a new [`vite-typesctipt`](https://www.electronforge.io/templates/vite-+-typescript) template :tada:

### How to Quick Start?

Once you have dependencies installed, type `yarn start` at terminal to run the project in development mode

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

### Electron main process&#x20;

Now, let's dive deeper into what's under the hood.

```typescript
// packages/main/src/index.ts

import { app } from "electron";

import { setupApplication } from "./app";

const gotTheLock = app.requestSingleInstanceLock();

if (!gotTheLock) {
    app.quit();
}

app.on("ready", setupApplication);

// Required to close the app on OS X when all windows are closed.
app.once("window-all-closed", () => {
    console.log("[MAIN] All Windows Closed");
    app.quit();
});

// https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/app#event-window-all-closed
// If the user pressed Cmd + Q, or the developer called app.quit(),
// Electron will first try to close all the windows and then emit the will-quit event,
// and in this case the window-all-closed event would not be emitted.
app.once("will-quit", () => {
    console.log("[MAIN] Closing Application");
    app.releaseSingleInstanceLock();
});
```

```typescript
// packages/main/src/app.ts

import { app } from "electron";

export const setupApplication = () => {
    try {
        console.log("[MAIN] Initializing application");
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("[MAIN] Error while initializing application", error);
        app.quit();
    }
};
```

### Renderers

Renderers' projects were bootstrapped with [vite react-ts template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project)

Next, I've prepared some simple boilerplate code for the sake of this workshop that should allow us to focus on Electron rather than on UI parts.
