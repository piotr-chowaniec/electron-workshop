# 3. Create your first Electron window

{% hint style="info" %}
Check out the changes we'll introduce in that stage [here](https://github.com/piotr-chowaniec/electron-workshop/commit/c1d5765bc30448216d4fcea1bb2a2b991784a21e)
{% endhint %}

To create a new window, we need to use Electrons `BrowserWindow` API.

Check out [Electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window) to learn more about`BrowserWindow` options, methods, events its instance is emitting, and so on.

## BrowserWindow

```typescript
// packages/main/src/mainWindow.ts

import path from "node:path";
import { BrowserWindow } from "electron";

export class MainWindow {
    private browserWindow: BrowserWindow;

    constructor() {
        this.createWindow();
    }

    private createWindow() {
        this.browserWindow = new BrowserWindow({
            width: 400,
            height: 400,
            x: 200,
            y: 200,
            webPreferences: {
                nodeIntegration: false,
                contextIsolation: true,
                sandbox: true,
                preload: path.join(__dirname, `preload.mainWindow.js`),
            },
        });

        if (MAIN_WINDOW_VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL) {
            this.browserWindow.loadURL(MAIN_WINDOW_VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL);
            this.browserWindow.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: "detach" });
        } else {
            this.browserWindow.loadFile(
                path.join(
                    __dirname,
                    `../renderer/${MAIN_WINDOW_VITE_NAME}/index.html`
                )
            );
        }
    }
}
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Pay attention to `BrowserWindow webPreferences` options. We'll talk about them in a minute. We have here:

* `nodeIntegration: false`
* `contextIsolation: false`
* `sandbox: true`
* `preload: path`
{% endhint %}

Next, we have to create a window instance from the class created above.

```typescript
//  packages/main/src/app.ts

import { app } from "electron";

import { MainWindow } from "./mainWindow";

interface IWindows {
    MAIN: MainWindow;
}

const WINDOWS: IWindows = {
    MAIN: null,
};

export const setupApplication = () => {
    try {
        console.log("[MAIN] Initializing application");

        WINDOWS.MAIN = new MainWindow(); // ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ 
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("[MAIN] Error while initializing application", error);
        app.quit();
    }
};
```

Go to the terminal, start the application and you should see a window being created!

## It's high time to talk about preload script!

What the heck is a preload script?

[Process model](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model)

> Preload scripts contain code that executes in a renderer process before its web content begins loading. These scripts run within the renderer context, but are granted more privileges by having access to Node.js APIs.

[Tutorial Preload](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-preload)

> Electron's main process is a Node.js environment that has full operating system access. On top of [Electron modules](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/app), you can also access [Node.js built-ins](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/), as well as any packages installed via npm. On the other hand, renderer processes run web pages and do not run Node.js by default for security reasons.
>
> To bridge Electron's different process types together, we will need to use a special script called a **preload**.

Long story short it's a handy way to expose Electron and Node.js APIs that are not available from website context. It's a bedrock we'll use to bridge the website (chromium) and a desktop layer (node).

## Security concerns

#### [NodeIntegration](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content)

> The goal is to limit the powers you grant to remote content, thus making it dramatically more difficult for an attacker to harm your users should they gain the ability to execute JavaScript on your website.

> A cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack is more dangerous if an attacker can jump out of the renderer process and execute code on the user's computer. Cross-site-scripting attacks are fairly common - and while an issue, their power is usually limited to messing with the website that they are executed on. Disabling Node.js integration helps prevent an XSS from being escalated into a so-called "Remote Code Execution" (RCE) attack

#### [ContextIsolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/context-isolation)

> Context Isolation is a feature that ensures that both your `preload` scripts and Electron's internal logic run in a separate context to the website you load in a [`webContents`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-contents). This is important for security purposes as it helps prevent the website from accessing Electron internals or the powerful APIs your preload script has access to.
>
> This means that the `window` object that your preload script has access to is actually a **different** object than the website would have access to. For example, if you set `window.hello = 'wave'` in your preload script and context isolation is enabled, `window.hello` will be undefined if the website tries to access it.

#### [Sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/sandbox)

> When the sandbox is enabled, renderer processes can only perform privileged tasks (such as interacting with the filesystem, making changes to the system, or spawning subprocesses) by delegating these tasks to the main process via inter-process communication (IPC).
