# 6. Close application gracefully

{% hint style="info" %}
Checkout to `stage-3` tag if you got lost in previous steps

See the changes we'll introduce in that stage [here](https://github.com/piotr-chowaniec/electron-workshop/commit/1337097cfca9a6bd30c64b4562c81177fe19dbcb)
{% endhint %}

### Goal

In the [previous stage](5.-create-login-window.md), we introduced some troublesome behavior by enabling a second active window. You have to manually close all application windows in order to shut it down. It's not the best UX so, we're about to fix it right away!

Let's define that MainWindow is a leading one, hence closing it should shut down the whole application. As usual, there are multiple solutions to the given challenge. This time though, we won't take a shortcut and call `app.quit()` at window `closed` event handler.&#x20;

Instead, let's learn how to pass some action to multiple windows!

### Code

```typescript
// packages/main/src/mainWindow.ts

...

constructor() {
    this.createWindow();
    this.registerHandlers();
}

...

private registerHandlers() {
    this.browserWindow.on("closed", () => {
        this.close();
    });
}

private close(): void {
    console.log("[MAIN WINDOW] Closing Application");

    const activeWindows = BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().filter(
        (window) => !window.isDestroyed()
    );

    activeWindows.forEach((window) => {
        window.close();
    });
}
```

You can use that approach whenever you need to notify all windows about some change/action. For instance to change language in all application windows.\
Instead of closing the window, you would send to all windows some common message, etc.
