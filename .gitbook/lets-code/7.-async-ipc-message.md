# 7. Async IPC message

### Goal

This time, our goal is to perform some asynchronous task at the main process which will be initialized by UI action.

Often things we're triggering at UI are asynchronous (surprise surprise...), hence we have to wait for a result. For example, one of such actions is user login. We already have a login window with the form in place, so we'll focus on renderer -> main -> renderer communication.

Lucky to us, there is Electron API that helps us handle such cases. We'll use:

* [`ipcRenderer.invoke(chanell, ...argsa)`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/ipc-renderer#ipcrendererinvokechannel-args) - to send a message from the renderer to the main over IPC layer and expect an asynchronous result
* [`ipcMain.handle(chanell, listener)`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/ipc-main#ipcmainhandlechannel-listener) - to attach the message listener at the main process. The eventual result of a listener will be returned as a reply to a remote caller&#x20;

### Code

```typescript
// packages/common/types/user.ts

export interface ILoginFormData {
    email: string;
    password: string;
}
```

```typescript
// packages/common/types/electronClient.ts

import { ILoginFormData } from "./user";

export interface ILoginWindowElectronClient {
    invokeSubmitLogin: (userToLogin: ILoginFormData) => void;
}
```

```typescript
// packages/main/src/constants.ts

export const LOGIN_WINDOW_ACTIONS = {
    SUBMIT: "@IPC_LOGIN_WINDOW/SUBMIT",
};
```

```typescript
// packages/main/src/preload.loginWindow.ts

import { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } from "electron";

import {
    ILoginFormData,
    ILoginWindowElectronClient,
} from "@electron-workshop/common";

import { LOGIN_WINDOW_ACTIONS } from "./constants";

const electronClient: ILoginWindowElectronClient = {
    invokeSubmitLogin: (userToLogin: ILoginFormData) => ipcRenderer.invoke(LOGIN_WINDOW_ACTIONS.SUBMIT, userToLogin),
};

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("electronClient", electronClient);
```

```typescript
// packages/renderers/loading-window/types/electronClient.d.ts

import type { ILoginWindowElectronClient } from "@electron-workshop/common";

declare global {
    interface Window {
        electronClient: ILoginWindowElectronClient;
    }
}
```

```typescript
// packages/renderers/loading-window/src/LoginForm.tsx

import { ILoginFormData } from "@electron-workshop/common";

...

const onSubmit = async (userToLogin: ILoginFormData) => {
    if (isSubmitting) {
        return;
    }

    try {
        await window.electronClient.invokeSubmitLogin(userToLogin);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to login", error);
    }
};

...
```

```typescript
// packages/main/src/app.ts

export const setupApplication = () => {
    try {
        ...
        
        ipcMain.handle(
            LOGIN_WINDOW_ACTIONS.SUBMIT,
            async (_event, userToLogin: ILoginFormData) => {
                try {
                    // simulate some API call
                    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
        
                    console.log("[MAIN] User authenticated", userToLogin);
                } catch (error) {
                    console.error(error);
                }
            }
        );
        
        ...
```

Although we don't return anything to LoginWindow here, we're positive that `onSubmit` won't finish until it was resolved or rejected in the main process.

### Is there a different way to do it ?!

One could argue that it's not the only way to do a job. And it's true!\
We should be able to attach a listener for some renderer message, perform a `async` task, and at the end reply to the message sender without blocking a renderer code.

It can look something like this:

```typescript
ipcMain.on("SOME_ACTION", (event: IpcMainEvent) => {
    try {
        const result = await something()
        this.browserWindow.webContents.send("SOME_ACTION_SUCCESS", result)
    } catch (error){
        // We don't need a window instance to reply to the sender!
        // It's super handy in some cases
        event.sender.send("SOME_ACTION_ERROR", "Error while doing something")
    }
})
```

The catch is, you can't attach an async listener to `ipcMain.on` nor `ipcMain.once` as it's causing TS errors. Well, things were way easier without TS, wasn't it?!

In addition, please keep in mind that with the above approach, you have to attach 3 different messages listeners on the renderer side!

Nonetheless, I personally prefer the first approach with `ipcRenderer.invoke` and  `ipcMain.handle` as it requires less code boilerplate and is easier to understand what to expect from various actions - you won't forget unintentionally to attach a success/error listener.&#x20;
